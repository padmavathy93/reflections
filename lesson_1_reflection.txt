How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   By highlighting the difference part and in which line it was found.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
	Helps in dealing with legacy issues by looking into previous versions and enables us to understand how to avoid it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros of Git being, avoidance of multiple versions that has only mineal changes whereas Google doc saves all changed version causing 
	somewhat like duplication. 
	Cons of Git, minor error tracking would'nt be possible if we do not commit accordingly unlike in Google doc that records all changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Makes creating versions easier unlike saving each file separately, incurs more manual work.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log indicates version history whereas git diff compares two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Version control enables us to retreat back to previous version that is functional in case the latest version causes issues.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to develop an Android App.
	
	Wikipedia, Google Docs and DropBox are popular version control systems.
