When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we have enough details to share our work, we can create a remote repository on GitHub and share it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manual pull enables us to know what is being pulled and we can modify accordingly and update in GitHub. Automatic changes made by the remote
repo could possibly lead to loss of information history.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: To copy one repository into our local GitHub, exclusive command of GitHub.
Clone: To copy GitHub repo into our computer.
Branches: Done in our local repository. Before pushing to GitHub.
